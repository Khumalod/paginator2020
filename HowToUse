1. Execute your sql select statement
2. Calculate the number of rows returned by your sql and pass them to the instance of the Paginator class
    Pass the number of rows you want to display per page as the first parameter.
        $paginator = new Paginator($rows_found,$per_page,$paginatorType);

                The $total_number of rows and $per_page are used by the Paginator class to calculate the last page..

                The formula for calculating the last page is $total rows found/ $per_page ..e.g
                if number of rows found is 15 and your $per_page variable is 5, your last page will be 15/5 = 3

                The last page is used by the paginator to generate pagination links..This is how pagination links are generated:
                for($i = 1; $ < $last_page, $i++){
                    //generate pagination links
                }

2. Execute your sql statement and pass the limit and the offset to your sql to get limited rows.
    $offset_and_limimt = 'LIMIT ' . $paginator->get_offset_and_limit();
    $sql = "SELECT * FROM $table $search_condition $offset_and_limimt ";
    The paginator calculates the offset for you



    OFFSET is used to specify on which row we should start querying the database...e.g if the offset is 5, the query
    will skip the first four rows and start and row 5
    limit specifies where we should end....
        the limit is your per_page variable, offset is a calculated value and is controlled by the current page & your per_page variable
        e.g for page one the offset will be 1 - 1 * $per_page =  0 * 5 = 0...
            this means for page 1 we start and row zero and end at row 5, if your per_page variable is 5
          for page two the the offset will be 2-1 * $per_page = 1*5
            this means that for page 2 will we start querying the database at row 5 and end at row 10, if your per_page variable is 5;
